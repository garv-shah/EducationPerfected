# EducationPerfected
In Grade 7, I created a script for Education Perfect which would automatically answer questions for me, which I made when I was competing with a friend to get points on the app. A few years later, I remembered the project and wanted to see if anybody had created anything similar to me. The only thing I was able to find was the script that Ken had created, which had a few pros compared to mine, but also a major con:

| Pros                                                                                                                                                                  | Cons                                                                          |

| Ken's version was a lot more usable. Mine utilised functions in the developer console, while his was packages into a simple userscript with hotkeys                   | My script had the ability to automatically answer questions, which his didn't |
| Ken's version was "semi-automatic", where'd you'd have to manually use ctrl-v to paste in the answer. It's quite nice to have both semi-automatic and automatic modes |                                                                               |

So, after seeing that I could help improve his script, I created a pull request with a little contribution! He approved it a few days later, and with new inspiriation, we both started working more on now revived project. Since then, we've added a lot more features, with Safari support, faster answering (async support) and more! It's quite fun adding new stuff every now and then, and hopefully we can eventually expand it to support audio tasks as well <br> <br>
:D
